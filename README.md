# Study-Planner

Welcome to my website called 'Study Planner'. This website is a free-to-use combination of some of the most popular revision tools/websites such as Anki and Quizlet; you can use it to store any tasks you may have or flashcards.

## Description

My website is made up of two main parts: a task manager and a flashcard manager. In the 'Task Manager' page, a user can store any tasks and their due dates in a table. In the 'Consolidation Menu', users can store flashcard sets (and display the links to them) in a table along with their description, allowing flashcards to be stored in categories of their topic. To access the sets, the user simply clicks a link in the Consolidation Menu, and they are taken to the relevant flashcard set's page.

  ### 🚫🍪 No Cookies

  It may be worth noting that my website does not run on cookies whatsoever. Instead, it stores your tasks and flashcard sets in your browser without an expiration date, using   the 'localStorage' property.
